    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Negative peer pressure can be super toxic, tbh. It's when your friends or people around you push you to do stuff that's not cool for you, like skipping school, trying bad habits, or even bullying others. It's like, they want you to fit in, but really, they're just holding you back. You gotta be strong and remember that it's okay to say no, even if it's hard. </p>
